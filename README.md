💖 A Love Letter to My Girlfriend

Welcome to the most important repository in my life – a small digital expression of something infinite: my love for you.

This isn’t just code, markdown, or text. It’s my heart, typed out one character at a time. A little project to say what I feel, in a way that’s uniquely us.


🌹 Why This Exists

Because you're amazing. Because words sometimes come easier through a keyboard. Because I wanted to do something sweet, nerdy, and full of heart. Because you deserve love that’s thoughtful, unexpected, and real.


💌 The Letter

You’ll find the full letter in letter.md – written with love, care, and maybe a few tears of joy.

It’s not a poem. It’s not perfect. But it’s honest, and it’s mine, just for you.


🧠 Tech Details (Because I’m a Little Nerdy)
Written in Markdown – simple, beautiful, readable.

Hosted on GitHub – because love should be open source 💻❤️.

Version-controlled – because even feelings can grow and evolve.

Commit messages? They’re my little diary entries.


📸 Optional Extras

You can add photos, memories, or even build a small webpage to display the letter more beautifully using HTML/CSS/JS if you’d like.


🔐 Privacy & Respect

This repository is just a sweet gesture. It’s not meant to overshare or invade our privacy. You can keep it private or public depending on how personal your message is.
