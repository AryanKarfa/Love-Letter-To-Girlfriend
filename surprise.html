                    He loves her deeply, but insecurities cloud his heart. He sees himself as unattractive—too heavy, too plain—wondering why she chose him when the world seems full of better options. Despite her unwavering love and constant reassurance, his doubts linger, whispering fears of inadequacy. He wants her to always stay, to never regret her choice.

Her love is his strength, his hope, and the reason he keeps striving forward.
